# The BokehBoard Manifest

Delivering and showcasing your photography is one of the most exciting parts of the creative process. Photographers who deliver proofs quickly and give their clients a beautiful way to share memories often earn more trust and referrals.

For years, hobbyist and professional photographers alike have invested into photo galleries only to be disappointed by stagnant features, platform lock-in, and increasing costs. Your photography is meant to be shared. The technology to share it should be accessible, affordable, and transparent.

We know that open source is the key to solving this need for photographers everywhere. Using open source kickstarts innovation by putting the open sharing of ideas and solutions first. With BokehBoard, we will create an open and globally accessible photography delivery platform to empower creatives everywhere. BokehBoard is built by and for the global creative community, listening and implementing what is needed. Being transparent with the code and enabling users to self-host the platform ensures that no person's creativity will ever be stifiled by limits or costs associated with commercial photography platforms.

We build BokehBoard for longevity by embracing the capital efficiency and inclusiveness of the Commercial Open Source (COSS) movement.
